# Weather-Prediction-using-Datetime
Predicting weather using Datetime, and comparing three classification models performances using accuracy score.

*Weather Prediction using Three machine learning algorithms*

>> The Three Machine Learning models selected for this project are: Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Extra Tree Classifiers.

The Dataset was gotten from the link  https://www.kaggle.com/code/alod83/using-datetime-for-weather-prediction/data 

Download the data and save in a folder ``dataset`` .
Run the notebook ``Weather Prediction Using ML``, the prediction was carried against the datatime.
